# React Hooks Password Generator 🚀

Welcome to the React Hooks Password Generator repository! This project harnesses the power of React hooks, including `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, and `useCallback`, to create a dynamic and customizable password generator.

## Features ✨

- **Live Refresh**: Adjust the password length, and watch the magic happen! The password dynamically refreshes as you change the length.
- **Include Numbers**: Want numbers in your password? Simply toggle the checkbox to include them.
- **Special Characters**: Spice things up with special characters! Toggle the special characters checkbox for an extra layer of complexity.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: A handy "Copy to Clipboard" button, powered by `react-hot-toast`, makes it easy to grab your generated password on the go.
